purpose:

The purpose is to modify our existing bank management program using object oriented programming. For this assignment we deal with designing and implementing a transaction control class, a transaction array and defining what a transaction itself is.  The program with these features essentially now has the ability to allow the user to deposit or withdraw money from accounts and display the transactions performed.
